Every hacker needs a good name!

I've noticed that there is a trend among hackers, groups, &c. to give themselves
names which are an adjective + a noun. 

Because of this, I've created an automatic hacker name generator, which takes a
random adjective and a random noun, pairs them together, and sends 10 names
out to the user. 

Enjoy!
